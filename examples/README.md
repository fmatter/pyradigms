# Example files

These are some example csv files to play around with `pyradigms` and help you get started.

## murrinhpatha_verb_entries.csv

* Language: [Murrinhpatha](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/murr1258)
* Source: Unimorph project, [Murrinhpatha repo](https://github.com/unimorph/mwf)

This is a long list of Murrinhpatha verb forms.
The data should probably not be taken at face value, as I had to correct two apparently homophonous roots *la* to *ila* ('surface classifier') and *ula* ('eating classifier' (?)), based on the information in [Mansfield (2014)](https://doi.org/10.25911/5d723cd88582b).
Thus, the entries in the Verb column should probably all be longer, but they suffice for practice purposes.
